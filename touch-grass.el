;;; touch-grass.el --- Remind yourself to go outside and touch grass -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Aleksandar Simic
;; Version: 1.0.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "30.1"))
;; Keywords: health, reminder, break
;; URL: https://github.com/dotemacs/touch-grass.el

;;; Commentary:

;; Touch Grass mode reminds you to take breaks and go outside at
;; configurable intervals. When the timer expires, it displays a
;; friendly reminder message encouraging you to step away from your
;; computer and touch some grass.

;; Usage:
;;   M-x touch-grass to start the mode
;;   M-x touch-grass again to stop the mode

;;; Code:
